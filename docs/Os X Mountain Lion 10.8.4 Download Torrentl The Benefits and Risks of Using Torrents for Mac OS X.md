If you want to upgrade your Mac to OS X Mountain Lion 10.8.4, the latest version of the operating system as of April 2023, you have two options: you can either download it from the Mac App Store for $19.99, or you can download a torrent file from the Internet Archive and create a bootable USB drive or DVD to install it.
 
The advantage of downloading from the Mac App Store is that you get a verified and official installer that will automatically update your Mac to the latest version of OS X Mountain Lion. The disadvantage is that you need a fast and reliable internet connection and enough storage space on your Mac.
 
The advantage of downloading a torrent file from the Internet Archive is that you can save bandwidth and time by downloading only the parts of the installer that you need. The disadvantage is that you need a torrent client such as uTorrent or Transmission to download the file, and you need to create a bootable USB drive or DVD using a tool such as DiskMaker X or Disk Utility.
